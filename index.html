        <p>I was born in Los Angeles, California, but was raised down in Atlanta, Georgia because I moved down south
            at an early age. Coming from a mixed background of marketing and risk management and insurance, coding
            is something that is totally new and foreign to me. I believe I have the creative aptitude to produce
            anything I put my mind to, and I am a firm believer of having a "gritty" work ethic and a "never give-up"
            attitude. I am a type of person who gets excited and engaged when learning a new skill or trade. In my
            spare time, some of my hobbies include: playing basketball, lifting weights, playing video games (mainly
            on PC), and just kicking back and watching some of my favorite TV shows. Oh, and coding of course, can't
            forget that one!
